     <p>
        Acclaimed by many as the world's greatest novel,
         Anna Karenina provides a vast panorama of contemporary life
          in Russia and of humanity in general. In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative 
          insight to create some of the most memorable characters in all of literature.
           Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin
            and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences.
             Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions
